🐍 DS & Algorithms in Python: LeetCode Solutions

🚀 Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, primarily sourced from LeetCode.

It serves as a detailed coding journal to document my journey in mastering algorithmic problem-solving, improving efficiency in competitive programming, and preparing for technical interviews. All solutions are implemented in Python, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and adherence to Python best practices.

🎯 Goals of this Repository

Mastery: Solidify understanding of core Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Maps, etc.).

Algorithmic Proficiency: Implement and optimize solutions for major algorithmic paradigms (Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, DFS/BFS, etc.).

Interview Preparation: Systematically work through high-frequency LeetCode questions essential for technical interviews.

Code Quality: Practice writing clean, well-commented, and Pythonic code.

📁 Repository Structure

Solutions are organized into directories based on the primary Data Structure or Algorithmic concept used to solve the problem.

✨ Getting Started

Prerequisites

You only need Python installed on your system to run these solutions.

Python (3.x recommended)

Running a Solution

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/AbdulrahmanMonged/DS---Algorithm-Python--LEETCODE-QUESTIONS-.git](https://github.com/AbdulrahmanMonged/DS---Algorithm-Python--LEETCODE-QUESTIONS-.git)
cd DS---Algorithm-Python--LEETCODE-QUESTIONS-


Navigate to a problem:

# Example: navigate to the Longest Common Prefix solution
cd Strings 


Execute the file:
Each Python file contains the class method solution and usually includes example test cases at the end.

python longest_common_prefix.py
