# DS & Algorithm Python — LeetCode Questions

## Overview  
This repository is a comprehensive collection of my solutions to various data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems, primarily sourced from LeetCode.  
It serves as a detailed coding journal to document my journey in mastering algorithmic problem-solving, improving efficiency in competitive programming, and preparing for technical interviews.  
All solutions are implemented in **Python**, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and adherence to Python best practices.

## Goals of this Repository  
- **Mastery of Data Structures**: Solidify understanding of core DS concepts (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Maps, etc.).  
- **Algorithmic Proficiency**: Implement and optimize solutions for major algorithmic paradigms (Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Two-Pointers, Sliding Window, DFS/BFS, etc.).  
- **Interview Preparation**: Systematically work through high-frequency LeetCode questions essential for technical interviews.  
- **Code Quality**: Practice writing clean, well-commented, and Pythonic code that is easy to read, maintain, and learn from.

## Repository Structure  
Solutions are organized into directories based on the *primary data structure or algorithmic concept* used to solve the problem.

| Directory Name             | Description                                               | Example Problem                       |
